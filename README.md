This project focuses on analysing console games dataset using sql queries. Here we are finding the answers of some questions asked by our user about the dataset using SQL.



## Questions

1. **Basic Data Retrieval:**
   
   - How many records are there in the dataset?
   - What are the distinct platforms available in the dataset?
   - What are the distinct genres available in the dataset?
   - What are the distinct publishers available in the dataset?

2. **Aggregation and Summary Statistics:**
   
   - What is the total number of games released each year?
   - What is the total global sales (sum of NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales) for each year?
   - What is the average sales (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales) for each genre?
   - What is the total sales for each platform?
   - What is the top-selling genre in terms of global sales?

3. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   
   - Which game has the highest NA_Sales?
   - Which game has the highest JP_Sales?
   - List the top 10 games with the highest global sales.
   - List the games released after a certain year.
   - List the games released between a range of years.

4. **Grouping and Aggregating:**
   
   - How many games were released for each platform?
   - What is the total sales for each genre in North America?
   - What is the average sales for each publisher in Europe?
   - How many games were released for each platform in each year?

5. **Joining Tables (if you have additional tables):**
   
   - If you have another table with information about the developers of the games, you could join it with this table to answer questions like "What is the total sales for games developed by each developer?"

6. **Subqueries and Advanced Filtering:**
   
   - List the games with sales above the average sales in North America.
   - List the games with sales above the average sales for their respective genres.
   - Find the games with sales above a certain threshold in all regions combined.

7. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   
   - Convert the sales columns (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales) to a consistent currency format.
   - Handle missing values if any.
   - Normalize sales data by dividing by the maximum sales value to bring them to a common scale.
